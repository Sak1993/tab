These are the practice scripts and main scripts that I have written as a part of my task at Digital Remedy New York when I was working as a Data Scientist Intern.The work that I have done here is trying to get information by hitting different APIs in python and then taking the required columns from the json files into using SQL Queries into SQL Database.Then after I have written a script to get a CSV File which includes the information for each day. Then at last I have written a script to make sure that this CSV file goes to a particular email at 5 am in the morning.At last I have automated the script using cron job.
